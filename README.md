# simple-baseconfiguration
ðŸ–§ Designed this topology usinf the software called Packet Tracer. It is a simple base configuration of remote access, line console and some access-control lists to play with. This network configuration uses RIP and is a working topology. Made this topology as part of my preparation for CCNA certification.
